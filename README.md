## Project Overview

This project involves building an image classification model to distinguish between images of dogs and cats. The process includes data preprocessing, using a pre-trained model, training the model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions on new images. The project uses TensorFlow and a pre-trained MobileNet model, and the code is structured into modular files for better organization and maintainability.
