## Project Overview

This project involves building an image classification model to distinguish between images of dogs and cats. The process includes data preprocessing, using a pre-trained model, training the model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions on new images. The project uses TensorFlow and a pre-trained MobileNet model, and the code is structured into modular files for better organization and maintainability.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arindal1/Dogs-Vs-Cats-Classifier.git
```

2. Install the required packages using the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

3. Make a Kaggle account, and make a new API token for your profile. Put the downloaded `kaggle.json` file in the main directory.

### Note:

Don't use the Python files from [/src](/src). I started with it but switched to Jupyter Notebook later, so it has *dependency issues*. Stick to **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Collab**.

## Dataset Used

We are using a Dogs vs Cats competition dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

![kaggle dataset](resources/s5.png)

### The Asira Dataset

**Asirra** (Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access) is a HIP that works by asking users to identify photographs of cats and dogs. This task is difficult for computers, but studies have shown that people can accomplish it quickly and accurately.

### Note:

The dataset present in this repository, at [/dataset](/dataset) is just for demonstrative purposes. It has just a few images to serve as an example of how the dataset looks like, and the directory structure. The original data is really big, so it couldn't be included in this repo, use the original dataset using it API call:
`kaggle competitions download -c dogs-vs-cats`

You can also download it from [Resources](#resources-and-external-links) and use it manually.

**Note:** This is a personal project created for educational and demonstrative purposes. I made this project just for fun and learn more about Machine Learning in the process, and also record my progress in this field. With this repo I want to help others like me who are interested in Machine Learning projects.
