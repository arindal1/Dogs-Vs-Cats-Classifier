## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to create an image classification model capable of distinguishing between images of dogs and cats. The project involves data preprocessing, building a deep learning model, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dogs-vs-cats-classification.git
```

2. Install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Collection

1. Download the dataset from the "Dogs vs Cats" Kaggle competition.
2. Extract the downloaded dataset and organize the images into the appropriate folders.

### Preprocessing

1. Resize the images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 pixels).
2. Convert the images to RGB format and preprocess them for model input.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Model Building

### Loading Pretrained Model

We leverage the MobileNet V2 model from TensorFlow Hub as a feature extractor.

### Creating the Model

1. Define a sequential model using TensorFlow's `Sequential` API.
2. Add the pretrained MobileNet V2 model as the first layer.
3. Add a dense layer for classification.

### Model Compilation

1. Compile the model using the appropriate optimizer and loss function.
2. Specify evaluation metrics.

### Model Training

1. Train the model using the training dataset.
2. Monitor training progress and save the best model checkpoint.

## Model Evaluation

1. Evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset.
2. Calculate accuracy and other relevant metrics.

## Making Predictions

1. Load the trained model.
2. Preprocess an input image for prediction.
3. Use the model to predict whether the image contains a dog or a cat.
